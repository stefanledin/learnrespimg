It's an illustration of a birthday cake that he has made in Inkscape. Sam has read that if he exports an SVG instead of an PNG, the illustration will look sharp on all screens no matter the resolution. He wants to try that! But he realizes of course that a PNG fallback is required. Maybe the <picture> element comes in handy here...?",
