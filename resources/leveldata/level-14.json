When we're just changing between different versions of the same image, <img> with srcset and sizes attributes seems to be recommended to use. But just for fun, can you help Sam convert the header image to a <picture> element instead?",
    "todo": "Create a <picture> element that works exactly like the following <img>. Use two <source> tags, one for medium and one for large. Add \"media\" attributes for the media queries. The small image should be the fallback.",
